Python/Flask Basic Login &amp; Registration Assignment

Coding Dojo Python assignment - Login Registration. 
Create a simple User Registration & Login page. 
Uses validations, session, login/logout. 
Outside assignment parameters, I also added basic CRUD operations -- user can edit their first name, last name, and email address. 
User can also delete their entire record, resulting in their session being cleared and data removed from database.
